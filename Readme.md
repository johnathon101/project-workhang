This is the first group project for the inaugural class at [Omaha Code School]("http://omahacodeschool.com"). It was created in a the fourth week of class and our first deployed project. [Michael Todd](https://github.com/michaelsedits), [Yofred Moik](https://github.com/yofred) and I wanted to create a system for students, mentors and anyone who works remotely to be able to connect with others who are in a similar situation.
