# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).

# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)


# User.create(fname: "Yofred", lname: "Moik", email: "ytmoik@gmail.com", password: "password". password_confirmation: "password", phone_num: [15087350340])
# Group.create(name: "Pro Rubyists Unite", desc: "Group where we make fun of other languages", mod: [1])
